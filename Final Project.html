          <h2><b><i>ðŸ§ Introduction to Final ProcjectðŸ§ </h2></b></i>
             <p> The task at hand was to integrate 3d printing, Laser Cutting and electronic into our product.</p>

             <p>We started out by looking at some ideas. Our original idea was to do a nixie clock.</p>

               <img src=" images/nixie clock.jpg" alt=" clock "width="500" height="300">
               <img src="images/digital nixie.jpg" alt=" clock example "width="200" height="400">

             <p>We plan to change the base into 3d printing while lazer cutting for the panel. We would also need to programme the electrical for LED light. For our Lazercutting we planned onnusing a clear arcyic as to light pass through.</p>

             <p>However due to the lack of time, we had to consideration the duration of make it would be too long and decided to change it into a moving light display.</p>

             <p>We started by drawing out the size of the base and panels while learning more about how the electrical surges are calculated </p>  

              <img src=" images/arcylic.jpg " alt=" measurement"width="300" height="350">
          
              <img src=" images/calculation.jpg " alt=" calculation"width="300" height="300">

             <p> Jin sheng and ye chun, I then drew it on fusion360 and Sketchup so we would have a better understanding.</p>

              <img src=" images/3d arcylic.jpg " alt=" panel"width="200" height="250">

            <p>Quickly deciding that the panel should be lazer cut as we needed the acrylic to be engrave we send out our first 2 copies to be cut.</p>

              <img src=" images/archylic.jpg " alt=" archylic"width="230" height="250">

            <p>Meanwhile Jin sheng was printing the 3D base.</p>

              <img src=" images/base.jpg " alt="basel"width="250" height="250">

            <p>When we tried to put them together we encounter some problem.</p>

            <ol>
              <li> Wrong acyclic thk  </li> 
              <li> Loss grasp of panels </li> 
              <li> Cutting wrongly </li> 

              <img src=" images/prod.jpg " alt=" wrong parts"width="300" height="250">

           <p>We had limited time so we planned to put our design tgt. </p>

           <p>Our initial idea was only able to be shown in such : </p>

                    </video>

           <p>Since we had limited time we were able to complete a new base and pick out the best few lazer cut to be used in our product.</b> Fortunately Jin sheng was able to make a new base. Ye Chun and I was able to pick out and clean the 6 arcyclic that could be use.</b> So now instead of spacing them apart we place them close to one another so we could give the effect more detph and at the same time ensure the cracks and scretches can be seen. </p>

          <p>Later we were able to quickly do up the lighting and ye chun and jin sheng were able to soder the elctrical parts together. In the mean time I had completed the poster. We also lined the inside of the base to allow the LED light to shine directly into the hole which the glass is placed on </p>
