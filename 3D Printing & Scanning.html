          <h2>Inroduction to 3D Printing & Scanning</h2>
          <p><i> 1st assignment: <b> Nametag</p></i></b> 
             <p>The assignment that we were given is to create a 3d print of a NameTag.</br>I used Fusion360 to design my name tag with an additional charater in it.</p>

             <p>During the making of the personalised keychain, I used a calligrph writing and an animal character on the keychain plate . I was onl able to that by: Adobe Photoshop enable to design it in 2d which i then input my chosen JPG design onto my finalised keychain plate.</p>

          <p><i>2nd assignment:<b>"Something within Something" </p></i></b>
             <p>The assignment given was to make "something within something". It could come in any shape but the idea was to create one item within another item without having any openings. 
             <p>I figure that i wanted a ball withiin another shape  with a twist. The idea was that i would be able to release the ball from its outer shape without letting the ball leave or come out of the outer shape.<p>

             <p>Mid way doing this assignment, Mr Chu told me how the ball would need to be on flat ground.This ensure that it has somewhere to build up, hence having it at the base of the outer shape.</p>

            <p>When the printing finish I had to slowly detach its supportsing walls and release ball from within the base outer shape. Unfortunately because of how thin the base is it made a hole at where the ball has been place.</p>

           <p><i>3rd assignment:<b> Group Proj</p></i></b>
           <p>The 3rd assignment was a group project that involve my friends:</p>

                  <ol>
                     <li>Teo Jin Sheng = Overhang</li>
                     <li>Koh Ye Chun = Bridging</li>
                      <li>Chai Jia Han = Clearence</li>
                  </ol>
    
          <p>I was in charge of testing infill density and this is what I came up with:</p>
